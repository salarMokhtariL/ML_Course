Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.


Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library



## History :
Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system, Its implementation began in December 1989 Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project

   2. IDLE 
   
   (For: Beginner __________________ Pricing: Free)
   
   When you install Python, IDLE is also installed by default. This makes it easy to get started in Python. Its major features include the Python shell window(interactive interpreter), auto-completion, syntax highlighting, smart indentation, and a basic integrated debugger.


IDLE is a decent IDE for learning as it's lightweight and simple to use. However, it's not for optimum for larger projects.

5. PyCharm


(For: Professional __________________ Pricing: Freemium)

PyCharm is an IDE for professional developers. It is created by JetBrains, a company known for creating great software development tools.

There are two versions of PyCharm:

* **Community** - free open-source version, lightweight, good for Python and scientific development

* **Professional** - paid version, full-featured IDE with support for Web development as well

PyCharm provides all major features that a good IDE should provide: code completion, code inspections, error-highlighting and fixes, debugging, version control system and code refactoring. All these features come out of the box.

Personally speaking, PyCharm is my favorite IDE for Python development.

The only major complaint I have heard about PyCharm is that it's resource-intensive. If you have a computer with a small amount of RAM (usually less than 4 GB), your computer may lag.
